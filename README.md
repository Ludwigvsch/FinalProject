# FinalProject

Task:
Implement a Java FX application that fetches data from an external REST API. You either need to be already familiar with RESTful web services or you will need to study up on it on your own. The application must use a data model that uses inheritance. It is best to use an example from the real world. The application does not need to be complex but it must be functional, well designed with organized code that follows Java formatting and coding standards.
